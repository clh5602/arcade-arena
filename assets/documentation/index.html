        <h2>Tutorial</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Arcade Arena! Do you have what it takes to run your own arcade?
            Fear not! This section will serve as a brief introduction to the game to
            help you get started on the right foot!
        </p>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>After renting a location and filing the necessary paperwork, your arcade is now
            open for business!... However, it seems you've neglected one crucial step - securing an inventory!
            With an empty building and whatever cash you found left in your pockets, you look forward to the future with
            excitement!
        </p>
        <h3>Get Some Machines!</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>As the owner of an arcade, your first priority should be securing machines for your customers to play! Visit
            the "Store" tab below to view a list of arcade machines and decorations available for purchase. Each item
            has a list of stats that will affect your revenue and popularity, so be sure to shop carefully!</p>
        <h3>Decorating Your Arcade</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Now that you've purchased some items, visit the "Arcade" tab to place them in your arcade. Items won't do
            anything
            unless they are actually placed in your arcade, so don't forget to do that. You can tap a tile on your floor plan 
            to select that space, then tap the bottom buttons to place the corresponding item onto that spot. Press the virtual buttons to rotate the item, or return
            something to the inventory
            by tapping the "X" button.
        </p>
        <h3>Open For Business!</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Once you've decorated the arcade to your liking, press the button below your arcade to open for the day.
            After a brief amount of time, you'll see several values, such as the number of visitors you've had, and
            your revenue for the day. <strong>Every seven days, you'll need to pay some bills</strong>, so make sure you
            have enough money
            in your account by the deadline, or it's game over!
        </p>
        <h3>What Should I Do?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Well, in the end, that's your choice! This arcade is yours to do with as you please... as long as you can
            keep up
            your regularly scheduled payments. However, if you're looking for some extra goals to make some quick cash,
            check out
            the "Tasks" page. Various tasks will appear here, and you'll be rewarded for each objective you complete.

        <h3>Proposal</h3>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I really feel like this was the first time I was able to "spread my wings" in this class, and I am grateful for the opportunity.
            After coming up with an idea and creating the proposal, I started development by laying out the architecture for my app. Implementing
            a paging functionality was my first priority, which I was able to do easily with the go_router package. That was my submission for the project prototype,
            which... was not the best showcase of my ability. I still had a lot to do, but now that my schedule was starting to clear up, I dedicated more and
            more time to this project. Eventually, I got on a roll, and worked for days on end. The feedback for my prototype mentioned using a webview for my documentation,
            so I worked on that first. I created this HTML page with some basic CSS, and used the webview package to launch it locally. I included links below to the different
            packages I used, but when the user would click on them, it would open the links inside this webview, with no way to return to the documentation. Therefore, I utilized
            the url_launcher package in addition to the webview package to make external links open in the device's browser. Now that the "About" page was handled, I delved into creating
            the game's data. I drew the sprites, created icons and splash screens, and started to work on the store page. Using a list view widget for the store seemed like a natural fit,
            and to my delight, it worked wonders. Starting work with the Flame engine was daunting, since I hadn't had any hands-on experience with it yet. However, after a few hours of
            messing around, and following tutorials on the Flame website, I was able to create something that I'm proud of. I'm not sure how the game looks on other devices, but it looks
            nice on the Pixel 7 that I used for testing. I attempted to use shared_preferences to save the user's arcade layout by converting it into a JSON string, but it didn't work out
            the best. Only the current day and money are saved in the final version, which are a little... useless. In the end, creating this project was a mental pain in the ass, but I'm delighted
            with the results, and I'm glad to have hands-on experience with mobile development.
